www.13leader.net



Summary
=======
AspeQt emulates Atari SIO peripherals when connected to an Atari 8-bit computer with an SIO2PC cable.
In that respect it's similar to programs like APE and Atari810. The main difference is that it's free
(unlike APE) and it's cross-platform (unlike Atari810 and APE).

Some features
=============
* Qt based GUI with drag and drop support.
* Cross-platform (currently Windows and x86-Linux)
* 15 disk drive emulation (drives 9-15 are only supported by SpartaDOS X)
* Text-only printer emulation with saving and printing of the output
* Cassette image playback
* Folders can be mounted as simulated Dos20s disks. (read-only, now with SDX compatibility, and bootable)
* Atari executables can be booted directly, optionally with high speed.
* Contents of image files can be viewed / changed
* AspeQt Client module RCL.COM. Runs on the Atari and is used to get/set Date/Time on the Atari plus a variety of other remote tasks.
* ApeTime client support.
* Upto 6xSIO speed and more if the serial port adaptor supports it (FTDI chip based cables are recommanded).
* Localization support (Currently for English, German, Polish, Russian, Slovak, Spanish and Turkish). ***this may be broken***
* Multi-session support
