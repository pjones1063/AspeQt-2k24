      <h2>Introduction</h2>
    </a>
    <p>AspeQt is a cross-platform, free and open source Atari 8-bit
      serial peripheral emulator.<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <p>AspeQt emulates various Atari 8-bit peripherals like disk drives
      and printers via a SIO2PC cable. If you are familiar with software
      like SIO2PC, APE, Atari810, AtariSlO, AspeQt, etc., you probably
      won’t have any problems getting used to AspeQt.<br>
      <br>
      Even though AspeQt is not fully mature yet, it is easy to use and,
      despite its shortcomings, has many features that you may find
      useful, the highlights being:</p>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>Cross-platform GUI with drag and drop support</li>
      <li>Atari Cartridge images to control disk and printer functions<br>
      </li>
      <li>15 emulated disk drives with support for 512 bytes per sector
        disk images</li>
      <li>High speed operation up to 6 times faster than the normal
        speed <em>(With compatible Atari OS / DOS)</em></li>
      <li>Ability to use PC folders as emulated disks</li>
      <li>Disk image explorer for viewing and modifying disk image
        contents</li>
      <li>Ability to run Atari executable directly without using disc
        images and Doses</li>
      <li>Printer emulation with preview and ATASCII support</li>
      <li>Cassette image playback with custom baud rate</li>
      <li>ability to save and restore AspeQt sessions with its UI
        settings.</li>
      <li>Normal and mini UI modes</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- System Requirements Section --> <a name="system">
      <h2>System Requirements</h2>
    </a>
    <p>AspeQt currently runs under Windows, Linux and Mac OS X. Other
      Unix-like operating systems shouldn’t require too much effort. The
      absolute minimums aren’t easy to tell but a modern Linux
      distribution with Qt 5 libraries or a Windows XP (or newer) is
      recommended.<br>
      <br>
      Although AspeQt is reported to run on a Pentium 233 MMX, a modern
      processor and a decent amount of RAM is strongly recommended for
      smooth operation. It runs fine on 64-bit CPUs.<br>
      <br>
      In order to do anything useful with AspeQt, you will need an Atari
      8-bit computer and a SIO2PC cable. SIO2PC cable is an interface
      that connects the Atari’s serial bus to the PC’s serial port.
      Since many newer PCs lack a real serial port, you may need a UART
      card, or a high quality Serial-to-USB adapter <em>(FTDI chip
        based devices were tested successfully, others may not work as
        intended)</em> or a SIO2PC USB interface <em>(instead of
        serial)</em>, If you opt for the latter however, please note
      that the “AtariMax SIO2PC Universal Interface USB Edition” is not
      officially supported as it uses proprietary USB device drivers.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>"Do It Yourself" SIO2PC build instructions - See:
          SIO2PC_Build_Instructions.pdf</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>You don’t need any real Atari disk drives or printers to use
      AspeQt.</p>
    <div align="right"><a href="#home">Up</a> </div>
    <hr>
    <!-- Configuration Section --> <a name="config">
      <h2>Configuration</h2>
    </a>
    <p>In order to be able to use AspeQt, you need to configure it to
      suit your hardware. When it’s running for the first time, a dialog
      will pop up asking you if you wish to open the configuration
      dialog. Click “Yes” to open the Options dialog. You can also
      access this dialog from the Tools/Options menu item.</p>
    <p>On Linux, you have to choose a serial I/O backend first. If you
      have installed the AtanSlO package and you have a RS-232 port, the
      recommended way is to use the AtariSlO backend. If you have a USB
      adapter or you don’t want to use AtariSIO for any other reason,
      choose the standard serial port backend. This is also the only
      available backend on Windows.</p>
    <h5>Configuring the standard serial port backend</h5>
    <p>First, enter a port name. On Windows, it should be something like
      COM1, COM2 etc. Check the device manager to see which one of them
      is installed. On Linux, it should be /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1 etc.
      for RS-232 ports or /dev/ttyUSB0, /dev/ttyUSB1 etc. for USB
      adapters.</p>
    <p>Next, you will have to select a handshaking method. The
      handshaking method tells AspeQt which one of the RS-232 pins is
      connected to Atari’s command line. There are 3 supported methods:
      RI, DSR, CTS and NONE. Check your SIO2PC interface’s documentation
      to learn which one of them is used for your cable. Note that NONE
      <em>(no handshaking)</em> is highly experimental and not
      recommanded for day-to-day use, in this mode AspeQt will ignore
      Atari's command line (SIO7) and will monitor the COM port's RXD
      (Atari SIO5) line instead. No handshaking mode was included to
      experiment with wireless (bluetooth) serial interfaces.</p>
    <p>The “High speed mode baud rate” combo box selects the transfer
      speed to be used for the high speed mode. Some OS /DOS for the
      Atari supports higher transfer speeds than the standard 19200 bits
      per second. Not all DOS /OS are capable of using 3x speed and some
      treat 2x as a special case for XF551 drives, so you may need some
      experimentation to find the best setting. 1x option is provided
      for unreliable connections, like when using a cheap USB adapter or
      when running AspeQt under virtualization software and/or on a slow
      CPU computer.</p>
    <p>If your serial port supports arbitrary bit rates, you may check
      the “Use non-standard” speeds check box and select a POKEY divisor
      to be used in high speed mode, the lower the divisor, the higher
      the speed. Usually real COM ports and some VCP <em>(Virtual COM
        Ports)</em> don't support arbitrary baud rates, FTDI chip based
      serial-to-USB cables do support arbitrary baud rates, and are thus
      the recommended type of cable for use with AspeQt.</p>
    <p>The exact formula for the nominal speed is:</p>
    <p>baudRate = clock/ (2*(divisor+7))</p>
    <p>Where dock is ~1,773,447 for PAL, and ~1,789,772 for NTSC,
      however, it’s not always possible to reach nominal speeds. So, 1x
      is divisor 40, 2x is divisor 16 and 3x is divisor 8. Divisor 0 is
      ~126kbits/secondn and that means approximately 6x.</p>
    <p>Please note that very few OS/DOS will be able to function with
      such high speeds. Currently the only tested software that can
      reach divisor 0 with AspeQt is the <a
        href="http://www.horus.com/%7Ehias/atari/#hipatch">hisio OS
        patch</a>.&nbsp;As a final warning, some Atari 8-bit computers
      have capacitors connected to their SIO lines that can interfere
      with high speed transfers. In short, speeds beyond 3x are not
      guaranteed to work in every case.</p>
    <p>The Complete/Error delay field selects the delay which is
      inserted after the Acknowledge response to a command by AspeQt,
      before AspeQt then sends the Complete response, or an Error
      response (whichever is appropriate). If you experience SIO errors
      or retries, increasing the value here should make the transfers
      more relible. Decreasing the value may <b>slightly</b> increase
      performance, but at the risk that you cause errors. There has to
      be a minimum delay from the last bit of the Ack to the first bit
      of Complete or Error, or the Atari might not recognize it. In most
      cases, this value does not need to be changed. The default values
      of 800μs and 300μs for OSX/linux/other and Windows, respectively,
      should be reasonable <b>if you have an FTDI based SIO2PC-USB</b>.
      If you have an RS232 SIO2PC connected to a real serial port, you
      can probably use a value closer to 300μs on linux/OSX/other than
      the default 800μs. <a
        href="https://github.com/jzatarski/AspeQt/issues/2">See issue #2</a>
      on github for more information about why this discrepancy between
      the default values exists.</p>
    <h5>Configuring AtariSIO backend</h5>
    <p><em>Note: AtariSIO is available under Linux only!</em></p>
    <p>After installing and running the AtariSIO module and making sure
      that you have the required permissions, you just need to enter a
      device name which should be /dev/atarisio0 under normal
      circumstances and select a handshaking method as described above
      for the standard serial port backend. Please refer to AtariSIO
      documentation on how to build and install AtariSIO.</p>

    <!-- Usage Section --> <a name="usage">
      <h2>Usage</h2>
    </a>
    <p>After making sure that you installed and configured AspeQt
      correctly, you can start using it with your Atari. If you used
      similar software before, it should be fairly straight forward.</p>
    <h5>AspeQt 2k25 - 8bit Cartridge</h5>
    <h5>
      <meta charset="utf-8">
    </h5>
    The AspeQt 8bit Cartridge can be run from most Atari cart emulators
    (UnoCart, Ultimate cart, etc.)<br>
    <br style="box-sizing: inherit;">
    All AspeQt disk and most printer functions can be done using the
    cartridge.<br>
    <br>
    Two versions of the cart are available:<br>
    <br>
    <b>MenuCart_BOOT_2k25.car &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

      <li>used to list atr/atx/pro/exe files from the cartridge - Option
        "B - List Host Images"</li>
    </ul>
    <p><br>
    </p>
    <h5>Disk images<br>
    </h5>
    <font size="-1"> <br>
    </font>Instead of using real disks, AspeQt uses disk images. These
    are regular files that contain an image of an Atari disk. There are
    several formats, the most common being the .atr format, currently
    AspeQt only supports .atr, .xfd, atx <em>(still in development),</em>
    and .pro&nbsp; formats. Future releases may provide support for
    .scp, .dcm, .di and gzipped (.atz. atr.gz, .xfz and .xfd.gz)
    formats.
    <p>AspeQt emulates 15 disk drives. You have one slot for each of
      them, labeled D1 through&nbsp; DO <em>(letter O)</em>. D9 through
      DO are only supported by SpartaDOS X and compatible DOS <em>(see
        SDX manual for details on supported disk drive identifiers)</em>.
      You can make AspeQt to show only the first slot, the first 8
      slots, or all 15 slots using options in DISK and WINDOW menu
      items. <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;+ To hide/show drives D9 through DO, use menu item Disk/Hide
      drives D9-DO <em>(CTRL+H)</em>,<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;+ To toggle AspeQt mini mode use menu item Window/Toggle
      Mini Mode <em>(CTRL+M)</em>,in mini mode AspeQt shows only the
      first drive slot,<br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;+ To toggle shade mode in mini mode use menu item Window<em>/</em>Toggle

      shade mode <em>(CTRL+S)</em>, in shade mode AspeQt shows a
      semi-transparent window which does not completely block the view
      of underlying UI objects,<br>
      <br>
      Note that all drives are actually available for use with your
      Atari in all AspeQt display modes whether they are visible or not.<br>
      <br>
      You can mount a disk image to an empty drive slot by</p>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>Dragging and dropping a file to the desired slot</li>
      <li>Using the “Disk/Mount disk image” menu item <em>(the first
          available slot will be used)</em></li>
      <li>Using the “Mount disk image” tool button available in each
        slot</li>
      <li>Right dicking on a slot and selecting the “Mount disk image”
        menu item</li>
      <li>Selecting a recently used disk image from the “Disk” menu</li>
      <li>By pressing Alt + 1 through Alt + O <em>(letter O)</em></li>
      <li>Using RCL remote module on the Atari computer <em>(See RCL
          section of the this user manual for more details)</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>You can see the result of your operation in the log display which
      is below the disk slots, if the operation is completed
      successfully, your Atari should be able to see the mounted disk
      image just like a real disk in a real drive.</p>
    <p>You can use the tool buttons and context menu items to perform
      other operations like saving the disk image, enabling write
      protection for the image, reverting the image to its last saved
      state, ejecting (unmounting) the image, creating a new image and
      so on. You can also swap images using drag and drop.</p>
    <h5>Folder Images</h5>
    <p>Folder images provide a similar function to the features
      variously named as “PC mirror’, “Simulated disk”, “Share point”
      etc. by other peripheral emulators. This is basically a simulated
      Atari DOS2.5 disk. Instead of a disk image, you can mount a folder
      in your PC that contains some Atari files and Atari will see it as
      a disk with the same files in it.</p>
    <p>Currently, the mounted folder will be seen as a standard DOS 2.5
      disk and it’s <em>sequential access (Basic NOTE/POINT commands
        will not work as expected) and read-only </em>. Although Folder
      Images are simulated and behave like Atari DOS 2.5, there are some
      differences. The most important difference is that each file can
      be as large as 8MB in size and file sizes are shown as number of
      bytes as opposed to number of sectors (unlike Atari DOS). Maximum
      number of files in the directory is 64 and subdirectories are not
      supported. Folder Images are also compatible with MyDOS, all
      versions of Spartados and SpartaDOS X. There may be issues with
      others.</p>
    <p>Folder images are also bootable as of version 0.8.5, but since
      the folder image is a simulation of a standard DOS 2.5 disk, you
      can only boot into a DOS that is compatible with AtariDOS disk
      structure. There are two exceptions to this, first one is
      SpartaDOS, AspeQt will allow you to boot into a 3.2G version of
      SpartaDOS but there are some limitations. AspeQt will also allow
      you to boot into the standard version of MyPicoDOS 4.05. See the
      following section for for details and limitations:</p>
    <h5>Folder boot details and limitations:</h5>
    <p>To boot your Atari with a Folder Image, first mount a PC folder
      to disk slot 1 (D1:). Once mounted, right-click on the Folder name
      and select <em>Folder Boot Options</em> from the menu, select the
      DOS you would like the boot and click <em>Apply</em>. make sure
      AspeQt is ready to receive commands from your Atari and finally
      turn your Atari ON, selected DOS will be booted. You must select a
      DOS boot option if you mounted a Folder Image for the first time
      and you want to boot your Atari from that folder whenever the
      folder is mounted. You normally only select the DOS option once
      for each Folder Image. The Folder will remain bootable with the
      same DOS between AspeQt sessions.</p>
    <p><strong>Warning:</strong> <em>AspeQt will copy the necessary DOS
        files into the mounted PC Folder to make it bootable. Do not
        keep any other DOS files (like dos.sys, dup.sys etc..) on that
        folder as they will be erased/replaced</em>.</p>
    <p>Note that you don't need to supply any DOS files, AspeQt
      distribution supplies the files necessary to boot your computer.
      These DOS files are copyright of their respective owners, 13th
      Leaderand AspeQt distributes those files with the understanding
      that they are either freeware, abandonware or public domain and
      are widely available for download through the internet. If you are
      the copyright holder of one or more of these files, and believe
      that distribution of these files constitutes a breach of your

        Leader</a>. We respect the rights of copyright holders and won't
      distribute copyrighted work without the rights holder's consent.<br>
      <br>
      The following DOSes can be booted from a Folder Image:</p>
    <ul type="square">
      <li><strong>Atari DOS 2.5</strong> AspeQt Folder images are fully
        compatible with this DOS, you can boot the DOS and load drivers
        and binary files <em>(autorun.sys)</em> during the boot
        process. AspeQt supplies the dos files <em>(dos.sys, dup.sys)</em>
        and the ramdisk driver <em>(ramdisk.com)</em>. You can add your
        own <em>autorun.sys</em> file by copying the file into the
        folder <strong><em>$bootata</em></strong> which is located in
        AspeQt application directory. You can also use DOS 2.0 instead
        of 2.5 by simply replacing the <em>dos.sys</em> and <em>dup.sys</em>
        in $bootata folder with the ones from a DOS 2.0 disk.</li>
      <li><strong>MyDOS 4.5</strong> This DOS is disk structure
        compatible with AtariDOS, so everything that's said for AtariDOS
        2.5 above is also valid for MyDOS. Boot files folder for MyDOS
        is <strong><em>$bootmyd</em></strong></li>
      <li><strong>MyPicoDOS 4.05</strong> This game DOS is provided to
        support Folder Images which hold Atari games. You can quickly
        boot and start your games conveniently from a PC Folder. Only
        standard version of MyPicoDOS is provided and supported. When
        selecting MyPicoDos as your boot DOS there is an extra option on
        the menu to <em>disable high speed SIO</em> code built into
        this DOS. If checked, this option will instruct MyPicoDOS to run
        in normal speed. This may be necessary under certain
        configurations. One example is if you are using an Ultimate 1MB
        board or a PBI device like IDE Plus 2 on your Atari with
        high-speed OS enabled. MyPicoDOS used in high-speed mode will
        conflict with the high-speed OS on the Atari, so checking this
        option and booting and running MyPicoDOS in normal speed will
        solve this problem.<br>
        <br>
        AspeQt will also automatically generate a <em>piconame.txt</em>
        file during the Folder Image boot process. So if you have game
        files with long file names they will be displayed with their
        full names when MyPicoDOS menu appears. <em>piconame.txt</em>
        file will only be created/updated when you boot, so if you add
        more game files to your PC folder during your MyPicoDOS session
        they will not show with long names until you reboot.<br>
        <br>
        Boot files folder for MyPicoDOS is <strong><em>$bootpic</em></strong>.
        it is not recommended to modify this folder, unlike AtariDOS and
        MyDOS there are no customizations you can make for MyPicoDOS.</li>
      <li><strong>SpartaDOS 3.2G</strong> SpartaDOS is not compatible
        with AtariDOS. Its disk/file structure and boot scheme is
        completely different. So this DOS is only partly <em>(and I
          would say rather crudely)</em> supported. You will be able to
        boot SpartaDOS version 3.2G from a Folder Image with the
        following limitations:<br>
        <ul type="square">
          <li>To boot SpartaDOS from an AtariDOS structured Folder Image
            is an impossible task. So AspeQt uses some <em>(not so
              elegant) </em>tricks to coerce SpartaDOS into booting
            from an AtariDOS compatible Folder Image by giving it the
            impression that it's booting from a SpartaDOS formatted
            disk. Once the boot is completed AspeQt forces SpartaDOS to
            re-detect the Folder Image as an AtariDOS formatted disk so
            that it can display and manipulate the files within the
            folder. The mechanics of this scheme necessarily limits the
            boot proccess in the following ways:<br>
            <ul type="square">
              <li>You can not load drivers or run an <em>autorun.bat</em>
                file during the boot process</li>
              <li>Once booted from, a Folder Image won't be bootable
                again until you right-click on the Folder Image name,
                select <em>Folder Boot Options</em>, select SpartaDOS
                3.2G and click <em>Apply</em>. This will reset the
                Folder Image boot files and will make the folder
                bootable once again.</li>
              <li>You can not modify/delete files in the boot files
                folder <em><strong>$bootspa</strong></em></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The restrictions and limitations may be lifted in the upcoming
        versions of AspeQt.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Running Atari executable<br>
    </h5>
    <p>Most Atari programs floating around on the internet come as Atari
      DOS executables. These files may have .exe, .com, .xex or any
      other extension. Instead of messing with disk image software and
      DOS, you may directly run these files in your Atari using AspeQt.</p>
    <p>You can either drag and drop a file with .exe, com or .xex
      extension into any slot or you can use the menu item “File/Boot
      Atari executable” to access this feature. A dialog with the
      necessary instructions will pop up and the file will be loaded and
      run. You can leave the dialog open to boot from the same
      executable more than once. A reload button is provided which will
      reload the executable into memory. This button is intended for
      atari software developers who may be developing on the PC and
      testing their software after making changes to it. Reload button
      will ensure the most recent executable is loaded from the PC, and
      as such is mainly a convenience feature for such developers.</p>
    <p>The executable booter has an optional high speed code which will
      allow you to load programs a lot faster. You can enable/disable it
      with the “Tools/Options/Emulation/Use high speed executable
      loader” check box. The high speed code is not able to cope with
      higher speeds than divisor 3 so check your configuration before
      attempting to load a file in this way.</p>
    <p>Please note that this feature is not compatible with every
      executable and, in practice, it’s not even possible to implement
      such a loader. High speed loader has even more issues. So there
      will always be some programs that you won’t be able to run with
      the executable booter but hopefully the number of the
      compatibility problems will decrease with future versions of
      AspeQt.</p>
    <h5>Cassette images</h5>
    <p>AspeQt can playback cassette images in .cas format. These are PC
      files that contain data extracted from an Atari cassette. You can
      either drag and drop a file with .cas extension into any slot or
      you can use the menu item “File/Playback cassette image” to access
      this feature. A dialog with the necessary instructions will pop up
      and the file will be played back.</p>
    <p>The cassette emulator can be configured to ignore the baud rate
      that is embedded in the image file in favor of a custom one. This
      may speed up the load times but can cause compatibility problems.
      You can enable/disable it with the “Tools/Options/Emulation/Use
      custom baud rate for cassette emulation” check box. When enabled,
      you can use the spin box below to set the custom baud rate. The
      available values range from 425 through 875 bps. These values are
      the lowest and highest speeds that the Atari OS can process. The
      normal speed is 600 bps.</p>
    <p>The cassette emulation does not support rewinding or seeking in
      the images. This may change in the future versions.</p>
    <h5>Printer output</h5>
    <p>AspeQt emulates a generic text-only Atari printer. It only
      emulates the first printer device, that is “P1:” You can view,
      save or print the emulated printer output using the “File/View
      printer text output”. Support for ASCII and ATASCII is provided.</p>
    <h5>Running multiple instances of AspeQt (Sessions)</h5>
    <p>AspeQt allows you to save and load your disk sessions, that is,
      the order and names of the mounted images and their settings. You
      can access this feature from the “File/Open session” and
      “File/Save session” menu items. As of version 0.8.2 AspeQt fully
      implements multi session capability. This means you can now launch
      multiple instances of AspeQt using different session files and
      have different configurations for each session. This makes
      possible serving more than one Atari computer from one PC so long
      as you have more than one COM port and SIO2PC cable available.
      Simply create different sessions with different settings and save
      them to a permanent session file (a file with .respeqt file
      extension).<br>
      If you plan on serving more than one Atari computer
      simultaneously, make sure that the PC is fast enough to handle
      similtaneous SIO requests as Atari SIO is very time critical and
      can fail if the requests are not serviced in a timely fashion.
      Experiment with the multi-session capability and verify that it
      can be run reliably before you put it on serious use.<br>
      <br>
      The following parameters can be configured for individual sessions
      <em>(stored in each session file)</em></p>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>Backend</li>
      <li>Atari SIO driver name</li>
      <li>Atari SIO handshaking method</li>
      <li>Serial port name</li>
      <li>Serial port handshaking method</li>
      <li>Serial port speed</li>
      <li>Serial port Pokey divisor</li>
      <li>Use of High speed exe loader</li>
      <li>Custom cassette baud rate</li>
      <li>Main window screen geometry</li>
      <li>Printer window screen geometry</li>

      <li>Other session related parameters <em>(like showing/hiding
          certain windows etc...)</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The following configuration parameters are global and apply to
      all sessions <em>(stored in Windows registry)</em></p>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>First Time flag <em>(indicates it's the first time ever
          AspeQt was launched on that computer)</em></li>
      <li>Last Disk image directory</li>
      <li>Last Folder image directory</li>
      <li>Last Cassette image directory</li>
      <li>Last Executable file directory</li>
      <li>Last Extract directory</li>
      <li>Last Saved Printer file directory</li>
      <li>Last Session file directory</li>
      <li>Minimize to tray option</li>
      <li>Recently mounted disk image file list</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="auto-style6">The following configuration parameters apply
      when AspeQt is launched without a session file <em>(stored in
        Windows registry)</em></p>
    <ul type="square">
      <li>Mounted disk image file list</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To launch a session, create a shortcut <em>(Windows)</em> or a
      link <em>(Unix/Linux)</em> in a folder with the session file name
      as a command line argument:<br>
      <br>
      An example of a shortcut for Windows would be:<br>
      <br>
      "C:\Program Files\AspeQt\AspeQt.exe"&nbsp; C:\Program
      Files\AspeQt\session.AspeQt<br>
      <br>
    </p>
    <h5>Apetime</h5>
    <p>AspeQt supports ApeTime <em>(Date/Time downloader utility)</em>
      from the AtariMax APE package. The support code has been added
      back in from older versions of AspeQt.</p>
